# OOP Practicals

This repository contains solutions to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) practicals for my university coursework at Ganpat University.

## Structure
Each practical is implemented as a separate Java file inside the `Practical-1` folder. The programs cover a variety of basic OOP and Java programming concepts, such as:

- Command-line argument parsing
- Mathematical calculations (area, perimeter, speed, interest, etc.)
- Basic input/output
- Use of variables and data types

## How to Run
1. **Compile a Java file:**
   ```sh
   javac FileName.java
   ```
2. **Run the compiled program:**
   ```sh
   java FileName [arguments]
   ```
   Replace `[arguments]` with the required command-line inputs for each program.

## Example
To run `Seven.java` (calculates area of a triangle and perimeter of a rectangle):
```sh
javac Seven.java
java Seven 5 10 4 6
```
